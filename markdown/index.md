**1. Declarative Provisioning**

Define your complete product stack (blueprint) in an easy to write Facets.cloud Stack Definition Language (JSON). The blueprint contains application definitions, cloud resources, database specifications and the dependencies between them.Â  The blueprint is version/access controlled and any number of deployments can be manifested out of it. These deployments can be QA, Staging, Load Test or multiple production environments on different cloud providers.

**2. Continuous Mutations**

Once deployed through Facets.cloud, the entire deployment can receive continuous mutations. These mutations can be regular application releases integrated with the CI systems or can be changes to resources like Databases, queues and their properties. Facets.cloud ensures that all changes are consistently deployed across all deployments of the stack.

**3. Optimized cloud cost**

Any deployment provisioned through Facets.cloud gets the best practice implementation for auto-scaling, spot utilization for optimal cloud spend. Additionally, since all resources and their dependencies are accounted for in the blueprint, the cost leakage is minimized.

**4. Observability First**

Facets.cloud components are developed with observability first approach. Infrastructure, application and cloud resource metrics get aggregated and pre-built dashboards and well-researched alerts are auto-configured. The alerts are pushed to chat-ops tools and custom notification channels.

**5. Built-in Security and compliance**

Deployments receive best practice point-to-site connectivity for developers and devops with role based access control. Networks, Security, SSL certificates are auto provisioned and managed by Facets. Antivirus, OSSEC tools come built-in with pre-built dashboards for monitoring and compliance. Facets.cloud ensures all critical components like Databases are backed by a disaster recovery solution.
