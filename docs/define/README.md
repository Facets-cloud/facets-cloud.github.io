## **How a Stack is organized**

**Stack** is a **git repository**. The top level folders of the repository denote application, infrastructure components,
database schemas and a few miscellaneous categories. Typically, a file specified in [FSDL](fsdl/gen/README.md) can be placed inside `/instances` directory of these top level folders for 
instantiating an object of that type.
