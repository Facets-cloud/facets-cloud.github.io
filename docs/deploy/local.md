# Facets.Local

Facets.local is a local manifestation of a FSDL stack definition. Developers can download a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box locally from the control plane.
With a few simple steps, they can get their entire microservices (or a part of it) running inside the local box.
This helps in micro-services development environments where partial dependent services can work locally for any developer.
